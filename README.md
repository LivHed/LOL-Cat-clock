# LOL Cat clock

## Made with HTML/CSS and Javascript.

### Check what time it is. Depending on the time different images and text will be displayed on the website. You can also set the time to wake up time, lunch time, nap time if you're having that time of the day now. And if you're just feeling like it's partytime already - click the Party time button and get started. Or click the button again if you want the clock to go back to what it was.
